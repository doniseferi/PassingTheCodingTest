# Random Node 
You are implementing a binary tree class from scratch which, in addition to _insert_, _find_, and _delete_, has a method _getRandomNode_() which returns a random node from the tree. **_All nodes should be equally likely to be chosen_**. Design and implement an algorithm for getRandomNode, and explain how you would implement the rest of the methods.
